# Risk Analisys

Risks and Security are directly proportional, the more you have of one, the more you have of the other. In this section, we will discuss the Risk Analisys.


The principals vectors of threats are:

- Human: The human factor is the most important vector of threats, because the human is the most
- Tecnologic: The tecnologic factor can be software or hardware, and can be a vector of threats.
- Natural: The natural factor can be a vector of threats, like a flood, earthquake, etc.
- Political: The political factor can be a vector of threats, like a war, embargo, etc.


All of these factors can be a vulnerability, and can be exploited by a threat actor, and this one become a probability of a risk.
